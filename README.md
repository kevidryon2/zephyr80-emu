# Zephyr80-Emu

## Features
### System
  - Using a Z80 which runs at 12.5875MHz.
  - SRC and DEST instead of HL and IX/IY
  - F is not the flags register, but an actual register.
  - Register pairs changed from BC,DE,HL to AB,CD,EF,SRC,DEST
  - Built-in multiplication/division inctructions
  - Built-in double-speed mode (25.175MHz)
  - RST $40, $48, $50, $58, $60, $68, $70, $78, $80
  - Block copy instruction (Copy AB bytes from SRC to DEST)
  - Exception handlers:
    - Illegal instruction = RST $80,
    - Arithmetic exception = RST $88,
    - Invalid memory bank = RST $90
  - Register swapping
  - Pointer calling (Call address that has the value pointed to by SRC)
  - Pointer offsetting (eg. Call address that has the value pointed to by SRC+A), (eg, Set A to the value pointed to by SRC+A)


- Graphics:
  - 16 palettes, each with 16 16-bit colors
  - 16 switchable tilesets, each 256 tiles
  - 16 switchable tilemaps, each 64x64 tiles big
  - A video resolution of VGA 640x480 (40x30 tiles)
  - 128 sprites

#### Banking

##### $FF00 (RAMBANK)
Controls the memory bank used by WRAM.

##### $FF01 (FLASHBANKA)
Controls the memory bank used by the FLASH memory region A.

##### $FF02 (FLASHBANKB)
Controls the memory bank used by the FLASH memory region B.

##### $FF03 (VTILESBANK)
Controls the memory bank used by the Tileset in VRAM.

##### $FF04 (VMAPBANK)
Controls the memory bank used by the Tilemap Tiles (first 4 bits) and Tilemap Palettes (last 4 bits) in VRAM.

##### $FF05 (OAMBANK)
Controls the memory bank used by OAM.

#### DMA

DMA starts at $FF06.

| Name 	| Offset 	| Size 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| DMA Channel #1 Source Addr. 	| 0 	| 2 	|
| DMA Channel #1 Destination Addr.	| 2 	| 2 	|

| DMA Channel #1 Flags 	| 5 	| 1 	|
| DMA Channel #2 Source Addr.	| 6 	| 2 	|
| DMA Channel #2 Destination Addr.	| 8 	| 2 	|
| DMA Channel #2 Data 	| 10 	| 1 	|
| DMA Channel #2 Flags 	| 11 	| 1 	|
| ... 	|  	|  	|
| DMA Channel #16 Source Addr.	| 90 	| 2 	|

| DMA Channel #16 Data 	| 94 	| 1 	|
| DMA Channel #16 Flags 	| 95 	| 1 	|

##### DMA Flags

- Bit 0: Auto-increment Source address
- Bit 1: Auto-increment Destination address
- Bit 2: Auto DMA (When this bit is set, the CPU is temporainly paused to perform DMA).
- Bit 3: Copy from Source Address (LOW) / Copy from Data (HIGH)

#### Other

##### $FF66 (VMODE)
The graphics mode used:

##### $FF67-$FF68 (VPOSX)
The X position of the "scanning beam" on the screen.

##### $FF69-$FF6A (VPOSY)
The Y position of the "scanning beam" on the screen.

#### Scanline interrupts

A scanline interrupt interrupts the CPU when the "scanning beam" reaches the desired scanline. The highest bit of each scanline interrupt determines wheteaver it is activated or not. When it is triggered, it resets to 0 if the second highest bit is set.

##### $FF6B-$FF6C (VINT0)
The 1st scanline interrupt.

##### $FF6D-$FF6E (VINT1)
The 2nd scanline interrupt.

...

##### $FF7B-$FF7C (VINT7)
The 8th scanline interrupt.
